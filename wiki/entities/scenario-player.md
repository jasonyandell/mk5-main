## What it is

`scenario/` is a from-scratch implementation of the player Jason's family
plays against every day in Plunge (`~/code/plunge`, the shipped mobile
game) and researches in `~/code/texas-42` — written in this repo from
*Walt: a mathematical account* (2026-10-09, `walt/math/` in texas-42) so
that this project's belief machinery can be run against it. The name
collides with the earlier [[walt]] on this wiki (the exact endgame
information-set solver of 2026-07-17); Jason ran out of names. This page
is the scenario player; the arena spec is `walt`.

The construction, in one line:

    Walt = R_live[ R_model[ U ] ]

A player holds a weighted set of scenarios (possible hidden situations),
chooses ONE action across every scenario it cannot tell apart, and lets
its plan branch only where an observation separates them:

    V(C) = max_a Σ_o V(C_{a,o})   at its own turn
         = Σ_o V(C_o)             at another seat's turn

The other seats are the same construction one rung down; random legal
play is the bottom rung, drawn from a tape keyed on the public record so
one scenario plays one tile at one record in every branch (worlds
partition, never multiply). A modeled seat's decision is a pure function
of (rung, seat, remaining hand, record) and is cached as such.

## Why it is not the wall

In the terms of [[belief-policy-value-algebra]]: [[expected-q-value|eq]]
is π deleted twice. The scenario player un-deletes both — the
continuation is one contingent plan over the cell (term 2 computed
natively, no [[strategy-fusion]] by construction), and the field is a
declared model with its own information. Value lives on information
states under a field. That is the object [[the-wall]] said was missing;
see the 2026-10-09 chapter of [[the-wall-biography]].

## The parts

| module | what | gated by |
|---|---|---|
| `scenario/rules.py` | per-declaration tables tabulated from `forge.oracle.tables` | parity with the zeb engine's legality and trick resolution |
| `scenario/record.py` | the public record a cell shares (played, trick, leader, banked, void-derived forbids); `advance` | replay of every engine history matches played/leader/trick/banked; voids never contradict the real hand |
| `scenario/fiber.py` | exact-uniform sampling of hidden-hand completions by a counting DP — no rejection, no invalid worlds | counts equal brute-force enumeration; empirical uniformity |
| `scenario/planner.py` | `Rung`, `Config`, `Walt`: the finite planning rule, the ladder, the dice tape, the `make`/`points` utilities | single-scenario value equals an independent best-plan search; the information inequality V(μ₁+μ₂) ≤ V(μ₁)+V(μ₂) on every split; scale invariance; determinism |
| `arena/walt_play.py` | the [[arena]] `PlayPolicy`; spec `walt[:k<level>][,n<outer>][,m<inner>][,h<horizon>][,g<inner horizon>][,u=make\|points]` | an arena half completes |

Tests: `python -m pytest scenario/tests -q` (17, CPU, no checkpoint).

## The levers (Θ = (G, I, u, β, S, k, H, L, ≺, Γ))

Every choice the mathematics names has a seat in the code: `β` is a
callable `(record, viewer, worlds) → weights` on `Walt(belief=…)`
(uniform by default — the g ≡ 0 limit); `k` is the number of rungs; `S`
is `n_worlds` per rung; `H` is `horizon` per rung (plays searched
explicitly; `None` = to the end); `L` is the tape playout at the
frontier; `u` is `make` or `points`; `≺` is lowest tile id; `Γ` is the
record-keyed tape. The belief seam is the point: it is where the
[[auction-decoder]], the [[gus]] belief head, and the tilt form
b = u·e^g plug in — the first time belief-weighting has had an honest
continuation to cash through.

## Measured (2026-10-09, M5 Max, pure Python)

Seconds per decision, three random states each, `make` utility, bid 30:

| plays so far | k0 n16 full | k0 n40 full | k1 n16 m4 g4 (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0.21 | 0.52 | 6.2 |
| 4 | 0.04 | 0.07 | 1.3 |
| 8 | 0.01 | 0.03 | 0.4 |
| 12 | 0.00 | 0.01 | 0.1 |

Smoke: `heuristic+walt:k0,n24` vs `heuristic+random`, 8 games to 3 marks,
seed 777: 8/8, +2.25 marks/game [+1.75, +2.62], made 80% vs 20%. The
meeting with `lens:ev` — E[Q] n=10, undefeated at play against every
learned challenger — is the pending measurement.
