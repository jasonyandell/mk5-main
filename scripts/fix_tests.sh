We have changed the frontend and now the e2e tests are failing and there may be other code quality issues. 
Please analyze the output and fix all issues including:
- Test failures
- Linting errors
- TypeScript errors
- Build errors
- Slow tests (timeouts > 2000)
- Non-deterministic e2e tests. Make a best effort to make them deterministic.
- Any other code quality issues

REQUIREMENT: The core game in src/game must be correct by construction.  Do not perform quick-fix solutions to the core game, do analyze how we can improve the code to be more correct.
REQUIREMENT: Do not change the UI (svelte) just because a test is failing.  The test is more likely (but not guaranteed) to be incorrect.
REQUIREMENT: Put locators into playwrightHelper.ts and not in the tests.  The tests should be pure and readable.
HINT: If you find a race condition, it is likely not a race condition at all, but that the helper is doing the wrong thing or the test is expecting the wrong behavior.  Look for comments that indicate places we know the helper is likely incorrect.  Find the correct behavior that does not involve switching tabs and update the helper.
CRITICAL: this is all local and there's no network delay.  when addressing timeouts, try to make things deterministic, including within the browser, if possible    

Warnings are errors. This is a greenfield project.
Make all tests (unit and e2e) thorough and maintainable.
Ensure code follows project conventions and passes all quality checks.

Once the tests are passing, you have ONE PRIMARY GOAL: IMPROVE E2E TEST PERFORMANCE.  Deterministic. LOW TIMEOUTS.
