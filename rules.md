## 1. Introduction and Authority

### Historical Context
Texas 42 was invented in 1887 by William Thomas (age 12) and Walter Earl (age 14) in Trapp Spring (now Garner), Parker County, Texas. Created to circumvent religious prohibitions on card games, the game was transmitted orally for over 100 years before systematic written documentation began in the 1990s.

### Authoritative Sources
This specification is compiled from:
- **National 42 Players Association (N42PA)** - Primary sanctioning body for tournaments
- **"Winning 42: Strategy & Lore of the National Game of Texas"** by Dennis Roberson (Texas Tech University Press, 1997-2009) - Definitive published rulebook
- **Texas State Historical Association** - Official state historical documentation
- **Major tournament authorities** including the Hallettsville Texas State Championship and Austin 42 Club

### Rule Categories
This specification presents two primary rule sets:
1. **Tournament Standard ("Straight 42")** - Used in N42PA sanctioned events
2. **Traditional Play** - Including accepted variations for casual/family games

## 2. Game Overview

### Basic Description
Texas 42 is a trick-taking game played with dominoes instead of cards. Four players in two fixed partnerships compete to reach a target score by bidding on and winning tricks containing counting dominoes.

### Core Principles
- Partnership game requiring teamwork and strategy
- Bidding determines trump suit and contract
- Points derived from tricks won and counting dominoes captured
- Communication between partners is strictly prohibited during play

---

## 3. Equipment and Setup

### Required Equipment
- **Dominoes**: One standard double-six domino set (28 pieces)
- **Players**: Exactly 4 players arranged in 2 partnerships
- **Seating**: Partners sit opposite each other
- **Scoring Materials**: Paper and pencil or specialized 42 scoring board

### Initial Setup Procedures

#### Determining First Dealer (Shaker)
1. All four players draw one domino face-down
2. Player drawing highest total pip count becomes first shaker
3. In case of tie, affected players redraw

#### Drawing Dominoes
**Standard Method (Tournament)**:
1. Shaker shuffles dominoes face-down
2. Non-shaking team draws first (7 dominoes each)
3. Shaker's partner draws next (7 dominoes)
4. Shaker draws last (7 dominoes)
5. No dominoes remain (no boneyard)

**Alternative Method (Regional)**:
- Shaker deals dominoes in clockwise rotation
- Some regions allow different drawing orders

#### Domino Arrangement
- **Tournament Rule**: Must arrange dominoes in 4-3 or 3-4 formation
- **Casual Play**: May hold dominoes in hand or arrange freely
- **Important**: Once bidding begins, dominoes cannot be rearranged

---

## 4. Complete Bidding Rules

### Basic Bidding Structure

#### Bidding Order
1. Player to left of shaker bids first
2. Bidding proceeds clockwise
3. Each player gets exactly one opportunity to bid or pass

#### Standard Bid Values
- **Point Bids**: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41

- **Exception**: Plunge bid may open at 4 marks (see Special Bids)

#### Sequential Bidding Rules
1. Each bid must exceed the previous bid
2. After reaching 42 (1 mark), subsequent bids must be in mark increments
3. **Critical Rule**: "Any player may bid up to 2 marks when 2 marks has not already been bid; subsequent bids may only be one additional mark"

### Special Bidding Situations

#### When Can You Bid 3 Marks?
**Standard Rule**: 3 marks can only be bid after another player has already bid 2 marks. It cannot be used as an opening bid under standard tournament rules.

**Variations**:
- Some casual groups allow 3-mark "splash" bids with specific hand requirements
- Regional rules may permit 3-mark opening bids for special contracts

#### When Can You Plunge?
**Plunge Requirements**:
1. Must hold at least 4 doubles in hand
2. Worth 4 marks minimum (5 if bidding has reached 4)
3. Can be declared as opening bid or jump bid
4. This is the ONLY case where jump bidding or opening above 2 marks is allowed

**Plunge Mechanics**:
- Partner names trump without consultation
- Partner leads first trick
- Must win all 7 tricks to succeed

#### Forced Bidding
**Tournament Rule**: If all players pass, hand is reshaken with next player as shaker

**Common Variation**: Shaker must bid minimum 30 if all others pass

### Bid Communication Rules
- **Tournament**: Bids must be single words only ("thirty," "pass," "two marks")
- **Prohibited**: No voice inflection, gestures, or additional commentary
- **Out-of-Turn Bids**: Stand as stated but cannot be modified when proper turn arrives

## 5. Gameplay Mechanics

### Trump Declaration
1. Winning bidder declares trump before playing first domino
2. Available trump options:
   - Any suit (blanks, ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes)
   - Doubles as trump
   - No-trump (follow-me)

### Basic Play Rules

#### Leading
- Bid winner leads to first trick
- Winner of each trick leads to next trick
- Any domino may be led

#### Following Suit
1. **Suit Determination**: Higher end of non-trump domino determines suit led
2. **Must Follow**: Players must play a domino of led suit if possible
3. **Trump Option**: May play trump if unable to follow suit
4. **Forced Play**: If unable to follow suit or trump, play any domino

#### Winning Tricks
**Order of Precedence**:
1. Highest trump played wins
2. If no trump played, highest domino of led suit wins
3. First played wins ties (in special games like Sevens)

### Doubles Rules

#### Standard (Tournament) Treatment
- Doubles belong to their natural suit
- 6-6 is highest six, 5-5 is highest five, etc.
- When doubles are trump, only the seven doubles are trump

#### Common Variations
1. **Doubles as Own Suit**: All doubles form separate suit from 6-6 (high) to 0-0 (low)
2. **Doubles Low**: Doubles become lowest in their suits (rare)
3. **Game-Specific**: Different treatment for Nel-O and other variants

### Renege Rules
**Definition**: Failure to follow suit when able

**Penalties**:
- **Tournament**: Immediate loss of hand plus penalty marks
- **Casual**: Often just loss of hand
- **Detection**: May be called when noticed, verified by examining played dominoes
