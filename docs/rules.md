2. **Trump Suit Non-Doubles** (by pip total): Highest pip count wins
3. **Non-Trump Suits** (by pip total within suit)

**Critical Rule**: All seven doubles are ALWAYS trump, regardless of the declared trump suit.

## Playing Phase

### Trick Structure

3. **Follow Clockwise**: Play proceeds clockwise around table

### Legal Plays
- **Must Follow Suit**: If able to play a domino of the suit led, must do so
- **Trump Rules**: All doubles are trump; dominoes with trump pips are trump suit
- **Cannot Follow**: If unable to follow suit, may play any domino
- **Renege Penalty**: Playing off-suit when able to follow suit forfeits hand

### Suit Determination
- **Doubles**: All doubles belong to trump suit
- **Trump Dominoes**: Any domino containing the trump pip
- **Other Suits**: Determined by higher pip value

### Trick Winner
- **Trump beats Non-Trump**: Any trump domino beats any non-trump domino
- **Within Trump**: Higher-ranked trump wins (see hierarchy above)
- **Within Non-Trump**: Higher pip total wins
- **Ties**: In non-trump suits, if equal pip totals, first played wins

## Scoring Phase

### Point Calculation
1. Count point values in tricks won by each team
2. Verify total equals 42 points (mathematical check)
