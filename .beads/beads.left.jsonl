There are remnants of both systems creating conflicts:\n\n### Current State (Broken)\n\n**strategies.ts:108** - Uses lexicographic scoring:\n```typescript\nconst handStrength = calculateLexicographicStrength(player.hand, state.trump, state);\n```\n\n**strategies.ts:116-124** - Compares against number-based thresholds:\n```typescript\nif (handStrength \u003c 30 \u0026\u0026 currentBidValue \u003e= 30) { /* pass */ }\nif (handStrength \u003c BID_THRESHOLDS.PASS) { /* pass */ }  // PASS = 55\n```\n\n**The Bug:**\n- Lexicographic scores: ~10^13 (ten trillion)\n- Number thresholds: 30-105\n- Result: AI always bids, never passes appropriately\n\n### System Inconsistencies\n\n1. **strategies.ts:7-8** - Correct function commented out:\n   ```typescript\n   //  calculateHandStrengthWithTrump,  // ← Old number system\n   ```\n\n2. **hand-strength.ts:30-38** - Thresholds designed for number system (0-150 range):\n   ```typescript\n   BID_THRESHOLDS = {\n     PASS: 55,\n     BID_31: 998,  // Impossible to reach except laydowns\n     // ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **lexicographic-strength.ts:101-119** - Returns huge numbers:\n   ```typescript\n   score += rank * Math.pow(100, 6-i);  // = 10^12+ range\n   ```\n\n### What Needs to Happen\n\n**Complete the lexicographic migration:**\n1. Remove/deprecate old number-based system (hand-strength.ts)\n2. Fix lexicographic score scaling to reasonable range (0-150)\n3. Create lexicographic-specific thresholds\n4. Thread lexicographic system throughout all AI decision points\n5. Remove dead code and commented imports\n6. Add tests validating bidding behavior\n\n## Files Affected\n\n- `src/game/ai/strategies.ts` - Main bidding logic\n- `src/game/ai/hand-strength.ts` - Old system (deprecate/remove)\n- `src/game/ai/lexicographic-strength.ts` - New system (needs threshold work)\n- `src/game/ai/hand-strength-components.ts` - May need lexicographic versions\n- Tests needed for bidding thresholds\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Lexicographic system fully integrated throughout\n- [ ] Old number-based scoring removed or clearly deprecated\n- [ ] AI bids appropriately (passes weak hands, bids progressively on strong hands)\n- [ ] No commented-out imports or dead code\n- [ ] Thresholds tuned and tested\n- [ ] Unit tests covering bid decision distribution\n\n## Philosophy Alignment\n\nThis is a \"crystal palace\" refactoring:\n- **Elegant**: One coherent scoring system, not two conflicting ones\n- **Simple**: Remove duplication and dead code\n- **Correct**: Fix the fundamental bidding bug","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-20T16:49:59.081168963-06:00","updated_at":"2025-11-20T16:49:59.081168963-06:00","source_repo":"."}
