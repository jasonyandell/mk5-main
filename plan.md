  ⎿ mk5 Project Plan: Best of Both Worlds

    Architecture Foundation

    Framework: TypeScript + Svelte 5 + Vite (from sixtyfouragents)
    State Management: Pure functional state machine (from mk4)
    Code Organization: Clean modular structure with separation of concerns

    Core Implementation Strategy

    1. Game Engine (from mk4's clean approach)

    - Pure functional state machine with immutable transitions
    - Centralized getNextStates() function returning action descriptors
    - Clean separation between game logic and UI concerns
    - Comprehensive rule validation in dedicated modules

    2. Type Safety & Developer Experience (from sixtyfouragents)

    - Full TypeScript implementation for compile-time safety
    - Comprehensive type definitions for all game entities
    - Modern tooling: ESLint, Prettier, strict tsconfig
    - Professional build pipeline with optimization

    3. Testing Infrastructure (enhanced from sixtyfouragents)

    - Comprehensive test helper class with 400+ lines of utilities
    - State injection via URL parameters for debugging
    - Automatic bug report generation with test code templates
    - Tournament compliance validation suite
    - Mathematical constant verification (42-point system)

    4. UI/UX Design (hybrid approach)

    - Clean information layout from mk4
    - Performance optimizations from sixtyfouragents
    - Responsive design with accessibility considerations
    - Hardware acceleration and CSS containment for performance

    5. Documentation & Rules (from mk4)

    - Include the complete 439-line formal Texas 42 specification
    - Comprehensive rule documentation with tournament vs casual variations
    - Clear bidding rules including special contracts
    - Historical context and authoritative sources

    - Automated tournament compliance checking
    - Mathematical verification of game constants
    - Bug report generation with reproducible test cases

    3. Performance & Accessibility

    - Hardware-accelerated rendering
    - Responsive design for all screen sizes
    - High DPI support and reduced motion preferences
    - CSS containment for optimal performance

    4. Developer Experience

    - Complete TypeScript coverage

    Implementation Phases

    Phase 1: Core game engine with pure functional architecture
    Phase 2: TypeScript type system and validation
    Phase 3: Svelte UI with performance optimizations
    Phase 4: Comprehensive testing infrastructure
    Phase 5: Documentation and polish

    This plan creates a production-ready Texas 42 implementation that combines 
    mk4's clean architecture with sixtyfouragents' professional development 
    practices.
